# Iris Species Classification

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a simple classification task that aims to classify Iris flowers into different species. The model is trained on the famous Iris Species dataset, available on Kaggle.

## Dataset

The Iris Species dataset is available on Kaggle: [Iris Species Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris).

- **Dataset Description:** The dataset includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

- **Dataset Structure:**
  - `iris.csv`: CSV file containing the measurements and corresponding labels.

## Model

The classification model is implemented. It uses a simple machine learning algorithm to classify iris species based on the provided measurements. Accuracy of 97% was acheived.
